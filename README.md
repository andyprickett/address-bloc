# Address Booc

#### Simple Node application for storing and retrieving contacts.

## Features
* Add and delete contacts.
* Search for a (very) specific contact.
* View all contacts.
* Check the current date!

## Technologies
* Just Node, no framework.
* Sequelize ORM with PostgreSQL database.
* Tests written in Jasmine.

## Comments
This application is based on a project completed for the Bloc Web Developer Track program. It is operational on my local machine, and should be able to be cloned.

## Usage
I am using this project for learning and experimentation with technologies.

* After cloning, run `npm install`.
* Run tests with `npm test`.
* Start the app with `node app`. You'll be presented with a menu.
